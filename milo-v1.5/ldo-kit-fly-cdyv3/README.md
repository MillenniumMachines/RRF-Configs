# Milo V1.5 - LDO Kit with Fly CDY-v3

## Intro

Provided here is a known-good configuration for the hardware in the LDO kit for the Milo V1.5.

Speeds, currents and functionality are configured based on the kit. To use, follow the instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) file.

## Notes

The LDO kit comes with a toolsetter, but not a touch probe. If you have purchased a touch probe yourself, you will need to edit the `touchprobe.g` file after starting the board for the first time, to set the correct pin.
